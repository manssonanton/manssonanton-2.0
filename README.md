# manssonanton: The web page

This is the repository for my personal webpages found on https://manssonanton.com

It will eventually be split into three parts, one photography page, one developer page and och landing page to choose between the two.

As of now only the photography page is actually online.

## 1.1 Photography page

It is built on Angular 9 (Upgraded to 10) with some PhP code in the backend to transmit the pictures from the DB.
Some packages, libraies and other resources have been used for the ease of it like for the animations and for the grid masonry.

  * Ngx-masonry
  * Iconmonster
  * Animate.css
  * Google fonts
  * GASP
 
## 1.2 Developer page

It is built with React and as of now it is a static web page
Some packages, libraies and other resources have been used for the scroller and for some of the animations.

  * React-scroll
  * Iconmonster
  * Animate.css
  * Google fonts
  * Framer motion
  
## 1.3 Landing page

It is built on Angular 9 (Upgraded to 10) as of now, might change it to something like python with flask just to try it out since it will be mostly a static page.
